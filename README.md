## Master thesis scripts

PHP scripts I wrote for assisting the investigation of gender-specific tagging behaviour on Instagram via content analysis.

_collect.php_ - collects pictures and metadata from Instagram for a given hashtag.

_correct.php_ - corrects the data according to the hashtag category the coders decided on after discussing the initial results.

_kalpha_base.php_ - reformats the data to run the Krippendorff alpha (intercoder reliability) calculation in SPSS from Hayes and Krippendorff (2007).
